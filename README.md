# AdaptiveTriggers_Example

In this tutorial I will explain how to use AdaptiveTriggers to resize the width of our ItemTemplate inside a Gridview, when the application changes size. When the application is reduced to a certain size, I want the ItemTemplate that has a fixed size (300 pixels) to take up the whole width of the page.
